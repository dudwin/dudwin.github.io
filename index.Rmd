I recently completed my doctorate in [Biostatistics at the Brown University School of Public Health](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home), where I explored interpretability in machine learning and non-additive variance estimation in the [Crawford Lab](http://www.lcrawlab.com).

Outside of academia, I have worked as a data scientist in all types of places, from Big Tech to nonprofit think tank. I hold an M.S. in Statistics from University of Massachusetts Amherst and a B.A. in Mathematics from Smith College.

In my spare time, I am knitting [an Icelandic sweater](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/riddari) and working on my conversational Chinese.
