I am a fourth-year doctoral student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home) at the Brown University School of Public Health, where I explore interpretability in machine learning and Bayesian methodology under the advisement of [Dr. Lorin Crawford](http://www.lcrawlab.com).

I was a member of the inaugural [Data Science Development Program](https://datascience.massmutual.com/dsdp) class at MassMutual Financial Group. I hold an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a B.A. in Mathematics from Smith College.

In my spare time, I am training for my next marathon and teaching my dog new tricks.

My full CV is available [here](CV.pdf).
