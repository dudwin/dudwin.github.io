My approach to teaching is laid-back. I will explain difficult concepts in as many ways as there are individual learning styles in a classroom. I'm even known for creating the answer key before office hours so that I can best anticipate students' needs A professional fun fact: student questions are my favorite emails to answer! Check out some of my experience below.
